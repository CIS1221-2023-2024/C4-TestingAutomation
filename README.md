Project – Testing Automation


Pre-Requisites

-	The aim is to set up a simple suite of automated tests which will ascertain the correct functionality of the key functions (method) of a main end-user program/code.

-	The programming languages selected to be used for this project/assignment will be Python and C#.

-	The idea is to model a simple stack, with related functions built in, namely ‘is empty’, ‘peek’, ‘length’, ‘push’ and ‘pop’.

-	Sample tests will then be set up for (at least) some of the functions, to ascertain correct and complete operation with the desired results.

-	About four primary tests for each function will be attempted. Where possible, upon completion of a test, the test will state whether a pass or fail was achieved for that function.

-	The tests selected will attempt to cover typical usage cases, and boundary/edge cases, where possible.

-	If possible, an attempt will also be made to measure or compare the tests being run between the two selected languages.

-	Consideration will be given to implement/utilize any available testing frameworks using the selected programming languages.
