A lot of work has been done on both Python and C# algorithms and both have their testing classes along with a menu to select options. The only issues are improper organization of files uploaded to the repository making it difficult to navigate them and some excess files are uploaded without any content such as the Class1.cs file in Priciples_Assignment_3 /Priciples_Assignment_3_Tests. With this, the naming of the folders could also be more specific. Other than that everything seems good and the code also has adequate comments which helps. The Wiki is empty but both the Pre-Requisites and Documentation are detailed and clear.
