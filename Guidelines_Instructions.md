# Testing Automation

# How to Run the Code and the Tests (and Review/Evaluate our Work)

# Python
- Clone or Download Zip of the respective Python project folder, containing the two files, main.py and test_main.py
- Place the Python project folder in a known location on your machine.
- Ensure that you have Python 3.1X installed on your machine.
- Open the project folder using a Python IDE of your choice. PyCharm CE 2023.3 is recommneded. 
- Select to run the main.py to see the Stack implementation with its features in action. User input is required to use the Stack.
- Select to run the test_main.py to see the Test suite execute automatically. The testing process is automated. No User input is required.
- During execution, informative text messages are displayed. After execution the IDE will show the test result. A green check mark should be displayed, and the test result should read: Tests Passed: 8 out of 8 tests, and the execution time is displayed in milliseconds.
- Feel free to review the code and evaluate our work. Read the comments to understand what each test does. You may also temporarily modify the code to try different test inputs and observe the resulting test output/results.
- Finally, make sure to read the Project Documentation to fully understand the Project concept, how the Project progressed, and our final observations.
- Enjoy! ;)
